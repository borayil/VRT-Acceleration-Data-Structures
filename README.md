# Acceleration data structures for Virtual Ray Tracer
This repository contains the Axis-aligned bounding box and Octree implementations in C# for [Virtual Ray Tracer](https://github.com/wezel/Virtual-Ray-Tracer), an open-source tool for helping with education and experimentation of ray tracing.  

You can find the full integrated version of the code along with the tutorial levels I developed within the official open-source version now, with [Virtual Ray Tracer 2.0 in your browser!](https://wezel.github.io/Virtual-Ray-Tracer/). Also available in [Google Play Store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RUG.VirtualRayTracer)   

This was also the main focus of the research in my thesis [B. Yilmaz: Acceleration data structures for Virtual Ray Tracer, BSc Thesis, University of Groningen, 2022.](https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/27838)
